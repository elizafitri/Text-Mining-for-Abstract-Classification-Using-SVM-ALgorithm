5,As the development of technologies in computers human beings are competing to create the newest technology in the form of hardware and software. The big companies are certainly use computer-based information system (CBIS) for example PT PLN (Persero) of  Lampung Region. PT PLN (Persero) of Lampung Region is a company that supplies electricity for Lampung Province.  They have activities that associated with mailing and receiving letter.  The received letters are accommodated in the secretary and are documented and archived using computer in semi manual manner. The computer system used less efficient and with given amount of letters often cause mistakes and slowness in registering them. This caused the slowness of searching of the archives and as well in generating and recap for the letters reporting.  Moreover the letters documentation security is absent. Because of that the existing system needs to be developed to improve services and good security.  This research goal is to make a system for a letters documentation that has security features such as logins and a good encryption and decryption using Twofish algorithms. This research used Visual basic 6.0 programming language combined with MySQL database and Crystal Report. The system development methodology used in this research is Waterfall.

1,Security and confidentiality of data transmission are two important aspects in the era of openness to data access and information. One way to secure the data transmission is using steganography. In this research the method used is End Of File (EOF) and used image as the medium. The message is hidden by inserting it in the end of the line image file. The media for hiding the message is in the form of .jpg and the output is in the form of .png. Inputting message is done manually. Testing have  been conducted on 5 types of images with different resolutions with a number of different messages characters which are 10 100 and 1000 characters. The results show that the method of End Of File (EOF) successfully used to hide message in the media image and to take back the message that has been inserted. The image size and the number of characters used affects the processing time for embedding and extracting. Cropping contrasting and brightness on stego image are conducted to analyze the resilience of the message inserted. The results show that the stego image manipulations are sensitive or resistant to the manipulation that makes the message becomes corrupted and are not recommended in manipulating stego image.
7,Knapsack Problem (KP) is known as one of combinatorial optimization problem that maximizes the amount of value (profit/ priority) of some of the items chosen to put in a sack or a bag without exceeding its capacity. KP has been applied in many fields: cargo loading budget control financial management and etc. In addition KP is also included in NP-Hard problem. Several research have been conducted using some heuristic method to solve it. Some of these methods are Branch and Bound Greedy Algorithms Dynamic Programming and Genetic Algorithms. However when using GA the feasibility of chromosome is one of critical issue. Most of optimization problem has constraint functions that will change the feasibility of solution. GA has some strategies to handle this case on the evaluation step. Evaluation not only calculates chromosome's fitness value but also handles the infeasible chromosomes presence. There're rejecting strategies repairing strategies and penalty strategy.This paper develops a strategy GA approach with chromosome repairing strategy. In order to see the performance of the algorithm we have done numerical experiment with several test problems taken on certain literature. In addition this study will also give variations in GA parameter to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.
1,The list of academic advisor utility is an utility that was developed to help the administration process of computer science major. Previously it's only used bubble sort sorting algorithm. We try to compare the bubble sort algorithm with selection sort and quick sort to determine the quickest algorithm which will be implemented in other major by searching the worst case (slowest execution time per unit) and best case (fastest execution time per unit). The result is quick < selection < bubble. Selection sort algorithm is proven to be the quickest when n < 26. But the  cademic advisor data that are used in the utility is more than 26. So in this research the quicksort algorithm is the fastest algorithm.

1,In 2015 Lecturer Activity Information System (SIKSEN) Department of Computer Science Unila experiencing data attacks (hack) which resulted in data lecturer activities can not appear in the information system. Attacking the data that occurred is one result of the lack of data security in Information Systems Computer Science Department. One way to secure data is to use cryptographic techniques. Cryptography is the way it does by encoding the original message into an elusive random message. In cryptography there are two main processes namely encryption and decryption. Encryption represents converting the original message into a password message while decryption is the process of returning the password message to the original message. The method used is Rivest Code 4 (RC4) because this method is one of the methods that the encoding result (ciphertext) has the same character length as the original message (plaintext). This method consists of three main stages: KSA (Key Scheduling Algorithm) PRGA (Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm) and XOR process. The data used in this study is the data of Unila Computer Science students amounting to 970 student data consisting of 25 columns of data. Testing is done by testing whether the number of original message characters is the same as the password and how much data is successfully encrypted and decrypted. The test results obtained that 970 data successfully encrypted and 970 data successfully decrypted with the same number of characters between the original message and password.

1,Technology makes communication better not limited by place and time. The form of communication that is often used is sending and receiving messages. This demands a strong security system. Cryptographic method is one way to secure messages by changing the form of messages so that they are difficult to understand. In addition the method of steganography is a way to hide messages into the container media. Cryptography and steganography make the security of a message better. In this study a comparison between RSA cryptography (Rivest Shamir Adleman) and cryptographic transposition columns inserted into the container media using AMELSBR (Adaptive Minimum Error Least Significant Bit Replacement) steganography with the container media in the form of images with the extension. JPG as input (cover image) and produces output .JPG (stegoimage). The conclusion obtained from this study is that the ciphertext transposition column has a faster time in the insertion process and produces a smaller stegoimage than the RSA ciphertext. But RSA ciphertext is more resistant to image cutting treatment than column ciphertext transposition. Some social media can send stegoimage perfectly if there is no compression process performed.

5,The number of cooperatives in Indonesia became the largest in the world. However the cooperative only contributes 4% of the Gross Domestic Product. It means most of the cooperative is managed unprofessionally. Many of the cooperatives are closed by the government as there are no annual members meeting and transparency of cooperatives business process. This shows that communication and data transparency in cooperatives is very important. But the cooperatives are difficult to show data transparancy and communicate with members because there is no media or something to support the communication for develop the cooperative. This research has succeeded in developing Multi Cooperative Information System using Laravel framework. Multi Cooperative Information System can store member data collection financial transactions calculating profit sharing and facilitate communication. This system build based on Software as a Service (SaaS) system so cooperative can subscribe with small amount of fee ignoring the development and maintaining the system.  This system already pass the test by black box testing and expert judgement.
5,Sale-purchase often expect the occurrence of mutually fair transaction. Perfect Competition Market is an ideal market structure because many sellers and buyers will be determined the price based on demand and supply. Continuous Double Auction (CDA) is one method that allows the occurrence of many transactions with the result that buyers get the cheapest price and the seller get a highest price. Currently transactions can be made online by multiple platforms that promise the information spacious seller and buyer access and perfect price competition. CDA method can also be applied to the online market system. This research tries to make e-auction system and simulate that  market commodities using CDA method focusing on the indication of price change (price fluctuation) that happened. The quantity of participants who make a sale or buy will also affect the price fluctuation changes. If there are more sellers than the buyer the market increase (Bullish) and otherwise the market decrease (Bearish). The simulation which applies profit-selling strategy will increase the price higher than the random simulation.

BP-KKN needs to apply risk management to reduce the risks that arise so that the problems caused do not result in the use of KKN information systems being hampered. The method used is NIST which is an information system risk management framework with three stages namely risk assessment risk mitigation and risk evaluation. KKN has 9 risks that can interfere with the sustainability of the information system. The final result of the KKN information system risk management is in the form of recommendations given to reduce the risk that will occur in the information system.
1,The development of technology and the internet allows everyone to exchange data and information. Problems arise when the information is confidential especially for a company institution and also individuals who have important documents and data. Therefore the security of the data is a must. In this case cryptography plays a role of encrypting secret messages into the form of unreadable messages and steganography that hides the irregular messages into the image media resulting in double security in the delivery of secret messages. In this research we develop a hybrid system using Vigenere and AMELSBR with cover media in the form of (.jpg) format as input (cover) file type (.png) as output (stegoimage) and data be inserted as a file with text format. The conclusion of this research is that the hybrid system can be used to encrypt the secret message and hide it into the cover media to make it more secure in data transmission. Therefore the use of AMELSBR method is good used in steganography. Stegoimage can withstand the process of manipulating the brightness and contrast with the image record must have the dominant black color value (rgb) or white (rgb) and not many color variants in other words the image can restore the file without experiencing excessive reduction of meaning after the manipulation of brightness and contrast is an image with binary image quality and grayscale image.
5,A numerous multiple transaction will create difficulties in managing and obtaining information for cooperative. Lack of resource and which is expensive make cooperative difficult to build by themself. Thats why many cooperatives do not use software in managing finances.
